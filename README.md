# Description

## You can forget about what day it is. The day will not be shown when it becomes morning or when you wake up.

# This mod was made at the request of FURF#0838 on Discord.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`



> `This mod is not needed on a server. It's client only. Install on each client that you wish to have the mod load.`



`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
